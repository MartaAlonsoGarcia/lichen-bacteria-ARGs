## Lichen-Associated Bacteria and Antibiotic Resistance Genes Analysis Script

This repository contains the R script used for the analyses presented in the preprint:

**Title:** Antibiotic resistance genes detected in lichens: insights from Cladonia stellaris
**BioRxiv preprint:** https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.28.656581

**Note:** Once the manuscript is published in a peer-reviewed journal, the repository will be updated with the official DOI link to the publication.

The script performs data filtering, antibiotic resistance geneâ€“bacteria association analyses, and generates visualizations of networks and relative abundances.
